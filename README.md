## Features

The main feature of the is to take in a location you provide and pull in the current weather and a 5 day weather forcast for that location. This project also uses the [OpenWeatherMap api](https://openweathermap.org/api) to gather the weather data.

## Credits

I did receive help from a tutor for setting up my routes and how to get started. I also used chat GPT when I was stuck on some of my routing and could not make headway between classes.
